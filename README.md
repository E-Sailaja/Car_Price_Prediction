# Car_Price_Prediction
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques like Linear and Lasso Regression can be used to predict car prices based on features like year, fuel type, transmission, and more. It’s ideal for beginners looking to learn regression modeling with real-world data.
# Car Price Prediction 🏎

This project predicts used car prices using two regression techniques:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression

## Dataset
- Contains attributes like year, fuel type, seller type, transmission, etc.
- Target: Selling Price

## Models Compared
- *Linear Regression*
- *Lasso Regression*

## Evaluation
- R² Score (on train/test)
- Scatter plots of predicted vs actual values

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Result
Linear Regression outperformed Lasso slightly.
